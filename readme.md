# Overview
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is essential for unraveling cellular heterogeneity and diversity, offering invaluable insights for bioinformatics advancements. Despite its potential, traditional clustering methods in scRNA-seq data analysis often neglect the structural information embedded in gene expression profiles, crucial for understanding cellular correlations and dependencies. Existing strategies, including graph neural networks, face challenges in handling the inefficiency due to scRNA-seq data's intrinsic high-dimension and high-sparsity. Addressing these limitations, we introduce scCDCG (single-cell RNA-seq Clustering via Deep Cut-informed Graph), a novel framework designed for efficient and accurate clustering of scRNA-seq data that simultaneously utilizes intercellular high-order structural information. scCDCG comprises three main components: (i) A graph embedding module utilizing deep cut-informed techniques, which effectively captures intercellular high-order structural information, overcoming the over-smoothing and inefficiency issues prevalent in prior graph neural network methods. (ii) A self-supervised learning module guided by optimal transport, tailored to accommodate the unique complexities of scRNA-seq data, specifically its high-dimension and high-sparsity. (iii) An autoencoder-based feature learning module that simplifies model complexity through effective dimension reduction and feature extraction. Our extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate scCDCG's superior performance and efficiency compared to 7 established models, underscoring scCDCG's potential as a transformative tool in scRNA-seq data analysis.

In conclusion, our study introduces scCDCG, an innovative framework for the efficient and accurate clustering of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scCDCG successfully navigates the challenges of high-dimension and high-sparsity through a synergistic combination of a graph embedding module with deep cut-informed techniques, a self-supervised learning module guided by optimal transport, and an autoencoder-based feature learning module. Our extensive evaluations on six datasets confirm scCDCG's superior performance over seven established models, marking it as a transformative tool for bioinformatics and cellular heterogeneity analysis. Looking forward, we aim to extend scCDCG's capabilities to integrate multi-omics data, enhancing its applicability in more complex biological contexts. Additionally, further exploration into the interpretability of the clustering results generated by scCDCG will be crucial for providing deeper biological insights and facilitating its adoption in clinical research settings. This future work will continue to expand the frontiers of scRNA-seq data analysis and its impact on understanding the complexities of cellular systems.




# Run Example
```shell
python train_scCDCG.py --dataname 'Meuro_human_Pancreas_cell' --num_class 9 --epochs 200 --foldername 'logger_folder' --gpu 0
```

# Requirements
We implement scCDCG in Python 3.7 based on PyTorch (version 1.12+cu113).

Keras --- 2.4.3
njumpy --- 1.19.5
pandas --- 1.3.5
Scanpy --- 1.8.2
torch --- 1.12.0


Please note that if using different versions, the results reported in our paper might not be able to repeat.

# The raw data
Setting data_file to the destination to the data (stored in h5 format, with two components X and Y, where X is the cell by gene count matrix and Y is the true labels), n_clusters to the number of clusters.
In order to ensure the accuracy of the experimental results, we conducted more than 10 times runs on all the datasets and reported the mean and variance of these running results, reducing the result bias caused by randomness and variability, so as to obtain more reliable and stable results. Hyperparameter settings for all datasets can be found in the code.
The final output reports the clustering performance, here is an example on Meuro_human_Pancreas_cell scRNA-seq data:

Final: ACC= 0.9265, NMI= 0.8681, ARI= 0.9137
